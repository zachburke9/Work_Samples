# Work Samples

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of projects that reflect how I think, build, and lead through data. Whether it's engineering automation, mentoring teammates, or analyzing key business metrics, my goal is always to deliver thoughtful, sustainable solutions.

These examples have been stripped of all company-specific data but are rooted in real business use cases. I hope they offer a clear picture of my technical mindset and approach. Feedback is always welcome — good or bad.
