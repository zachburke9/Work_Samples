## Project Areas

### 1. SQL ETL
An end-to-end ETL solution that demonstrates:
- Complex SQL transformations for cost data consolidation
- Multiple cost items per service transaction handling
- Alteryx workflow automation for system integration
- Best practices in data warehouse operations

### 2. Analytics Engineering
Collection of Python projects showcasing:
- Automated reporting and anomaly detection
- ML-based booking predictions
- Technical mentorship materials
- Email automation systems

For detailed information about each project area, please see their respective README files.

## About These Code Samples

- Each project is contained in its own Python script for easy execution.
- These are **illustrative code samples**, not full production-ready implementations. They are meant to highlight methodology, problem-solving techniques, and technical expertise.
- The provided scripts are structured for clarity and reproducibility, ensuring ease of understanding and modification.

## Running the Code

All Python projects can be run from the Python_Projects directory:

```bash
cd Python_Projects

# Install dependencies first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run any project
python automated_reporting.py
python historical_booking_predictions.py
```

### Dependencies
All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some code may require dataset placeholders. Ensure that relevant CSV files or database connections are set up where applicable.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Automated Reporting & Anomaly Detection (`automated_reporting.py`)
- Implements data processing, rolling averages, and statistical deviation detection to identify significant changes in business metrics.
- Helps automate alerting for unusual patterns in data.

### 2. Historical Booking Predictions (`historical_booking_predictions.py`)
- Builds a predictive model to forecast booking trends using `scikit-learn` with feature engineering and model evaluation.
- Uses machine learning techniques to analyze past booking behaviors and predict future demand.

### 3. Mentorship & Technical Leadership (`mentorship_training.py`)
- Includes training examples for junior analysts, covering data validation, SQL best practices, and structured coding techniques.
- Provides fundamental exercises to reinforce best practices in data analytics and pipeline development.

### 4. Automated Email Alerts (`automated_email_alerts.py`)
- Integrates with anomaly detection from `automated_reporting.py` to send automated email alerts for significant deviations in data.
- Uses Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries to format and send notifications.

Each project is structured to showcase a mix of **data processing, automation, machine learning, and technical mentorship** skills. While the samples are simplified for clarity, they reflect real-world analytical workflows and best practices.
